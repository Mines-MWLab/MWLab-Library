# Microwave & RF Research Group – Design Submission Repository

Welcome to the official design submission repository of the **Microwave & RF Research Group** at the **University of Colorado Boulder**. This repository serves as a centralized platform for managing and sharing design files intended for fabrication of **RF** and **photonic integrated circuits (ICs)**.

## Purpose

This repository is intended to:
- Share and version control design files for RF and photonic IC fabrication.
- Enable collaboration and knowledge sharing among group members.
- Maintain a record of traceable changes and design iterations.
- Promote reproducibility and good engineering practices.

## Who We Are

We are a research group based in the **ECEE Department at CU Boulder**, working on cutting-edge research in microwave, millimeter-wave, and photonic integrated systems.
