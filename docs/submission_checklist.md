# Design Submission Checklist

(This is a dummy checklist to be updated)

This checklist is intended to ensure your design is ready for submission to a photonic foundry for fabrication. Please review each item and check it off before submitting.

##  General Information

- [ ] Project title and short description included.
- [ ] PI and student contributor names and contact information provided.
- [ ] Target foundry and process node clearly identified.
- [ ] Submission deadline and tape-out schedule confirmed.

---

##  Design Files

- [ ] Final GDSII file exported and verified.
- [ ] Layer map (e.g., `.lyp`) file included and up to date.
- [ ] Annotated design schematic included.
- [ ] Netlist or connectivity report exported (if applicable).
- [ ] Design rule check (DRC) run and passed with documentation of any exceptions.
- [ ] Layout versus schematic (LVS) check completed (if applicable).
- [ ] Compact model parameters or PDK references included.

##  Packaging & Test

- [ ] Padframe and I/O locations clearly labeled.
- [ ] Test structures included and documented.
- [ ] Wafer layout/top-level die placement confirmed.
- [ ] Expected packaging requirements described (e.g., fiber arrays, RF probes).

---

##  Documentation

- [ ] `README.md` file describing the contents of the submission directory.
- [ ] Bill of materials (BOM) or list of key components used.
- [ ] Simulation or performance validation results attached (optical/RF).
- [ ] Design version tagged (e.g., `v1.0`, `revB`).
- [ ] Changelog of significant modifications provided.

---

##  Submission Prep

- [ ] File names follow foundry or group naming conventions.
- [ ] Archive file (e.g., `.zip` or `.tar.gz`) created with all necessary contents.
- [ ] File sizes checked to ensure they meet portal/email upload limits.
- [ ] Internal review completed with PI and group members.
